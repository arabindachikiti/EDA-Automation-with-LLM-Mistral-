# EDA-Automation-with-LLM-Mistral-
ðŸ¤– EDA Automation with LLM (Mistral) â€“ Project Description
Overview:

This project leverages Mistral, a high-performance large language model, to automate Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) tasks. By integrating natural language capabilities with structured data workflows, the tool intelligently interprets datasets and generates descriptive insights, statistical summaries, and visualizations â€” all with minimal human input.

Key Features:

ðŸ§  LLM-Powered Analysis

Uses Mistral to automatically describe datasets, identify data types, and generate meaningful summaries.

Supports plain language queries for flexible, human-like data interaction.

ðŸ“Š Automated EDA Pipeline

Summarizes columns: count, missing values, unique entries, data type

Detects numerical vs categorical features

Outputs:

Descriptive statistics

Histograms, box plots, bar charts

Correlation matrices and heatmaps

ðŸ“ˆ Insight Generation

LLM prompts drive automatic insights:

Trends and anomalies

Outliers

Feature relationships

ðŸ’¬ Conversational Interface (optional)

Users can chat with the data through natural language prompts

Dynamic code generation for further analysis

Tech Stack:

Mistral LLM (via API or local inference)

Python

Pandas / NumPy

Matplotlib / Seaborn (for visualizations)
